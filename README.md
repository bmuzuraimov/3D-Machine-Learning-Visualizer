# 3D Machine Learning Visualizer

## Project Overview

The 3D Machine Learning Visualizer is an educational tool designed to demystify the inner workings of various machine learning algorithms through interactive 3D visualizations. Using Three.js, this project allows users to explore and interact with different algorithms, including DBSCAN, SVM, K-Means, KNN, and Decision Trees, to gain a deeper understanding of their mechanics and applications.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualizations:** Each algorithm is represented through a unique and dynamic 3D scene.
- **Real-time Algorithm Parameter Adjustments:** Users can modify algorithm parameters on-the-fly to see how changes affect the outcome.
- **Multiple Algorithm Support:** Visualize and learn about different machine learning algorithms in one platform.
- **Educational Tool:** Ideal for students, educators, or anyone curious about machine learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-ml-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd 3d-ml-visualizer
